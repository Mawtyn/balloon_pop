A three-dimensional tribute of a popular two-dimensional game,
Bloons Tower Defense. The goal of the game is to pop all balloons following a fixed path before
they reach an end goal. In the original game, the balloons were popped automatically by placed
towers; in our version, since we are working in three-dimensions, we will require the player to
actually aim at the balloons (which are moving) and hit them with a projectile dart.

Interactivity:
The game will be in first-person, so there is a first-person camera and movement controls (mouse
to look left and right and up and down and WASD to move forward, left, backwards, and right).
The player will shoot projectile darts using the “space” key, which can pop the
balloons moving through the map. As the player pops balloons, they will earn points which they
can spend on upgrades for their projectiles - such as increasing their throwing speed, increasing
their projectile speed, shooting multiple projectiles at once, and so forth.
